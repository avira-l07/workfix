 * - DOWNLOADED: pack files are present and verified on disk
 *   ([LanguagePackInstallState.INSTALLED] or [LanguagePackInstallState.UPDATE_AVAILABLE]),
 *   but this pack is not necessarily loaded into memory right now.
 * - ACTIVE: this pack is DOWNLOADED *and* is the single language currently
 *   loaded into inference memory (see ActiveLanguageSessionManager).
 *
 * A pack can be ACTIVE only if it is also DOWNLOADED. At most one pack in
 * the whole system may be ACTIVE at any time — that invariant is enforced
 * by the active-language session manager, not by this enum.
