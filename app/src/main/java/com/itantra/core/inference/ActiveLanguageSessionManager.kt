/**
 * Enforces the project's core model-lifecycle rule:
 *
 *   Many language packs may exist in storage, BUT only the currently
 *   selected language's heavy inference assets may be resident in memory
 *   at once.
 *
 * This class owns the transition:
 *
 *   Hindi active -> switch to Tamil -> unload Hindi engines ->
 *   load Tamil engines -> Tamil active
 *
 * It does NOT itself decide which pack is "installed" (that is
 * [com.itantra.domain.repository.LanguagePackRepository]'s job) and it
 * relies on the [EngineFactory] provided at construction to build real
 * [SpeechRecognizerEngine] / [SpeechSynthesizerEngine] instances per
 * language. See [com.itantra.app.AppGraph] for the production wiring.
 *
 * Concurrency: [switchTo] is serialized with a [Mutex] so two rapid
 * language switches can't race and leave two languages' engines loaded at
 * once, or leave neither loaded.
